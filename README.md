# pschown
A powershell module that repliacates some of the chown commands.

---chown---
I have yet to start this file, but it will be kept simple: run the command to obtain ownership 
of a file / folder.

---chmod---
As of right now, I have yet to decide what all functions I will be doing with the octals. 

The first set will be the current user, the third will be everyone, but I am not sure
what the second one will be.
